# cpp-grade-analyzer
Code Calculates grades, grade point average, sorts data and calculates grade distribution for individual classes

THe current code does the Following:
*imports students names scores and grades from a file (First Name, Last Name, MathHW1 Score, Math HW2 Score, Math HW3 Score, Math Exam1 Score, Math Exam 2 Score, Math Project Score, English Letter Grade, Chemistry Letter Grade, History Letter Grade, Engineering Safety Letter Grade)
*Print's the imported data
*calculate the course final score for math useg this Weight (40% for Assignments, %40% for exams and 10% for Project)
*Assigns Letter grade for students using this policy (90-100: A, 80-89.99: B, 70-79.99: C, 60-69.99: D and <60: F)
*Calculate the Grade distribution percentage for the student performance in the Math course (%As, %Bs, %Cs, %Ds and %Fs)
*Calculates Semester Semester GPA based on grades from other courses
*Sort the data based on the student Semester GPA Scores
*Print the Sorted data with including the math score, course Grade, and Semester GPA
*Print the course grade distribution

Modify this and the data to ensure that the code is able to satisfy all the design requirements listed above.

Solution Approach:
1. Run the code and evaluate what features are included and identify the changes that need to be made to the code and the data file.
2. Execute and test modification  until the objective ia achieved. Fee free to utilize AI Coding Assistants.
